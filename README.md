# GoonBoard-HE
## Overview
This repository contains the firmware source code for building a USB HID keyboard with the Pro Micro development board using hall-effect switches.

| HE Sensor       | Nanjing Ouzhuo Tech  | OH49E-S           | 0.18             |
| HE Switch       | Gateron              | KS-20T (90 pcs)   | 57.60            |

## Compiling and Uploading
Since I have used the PlatformIO toolchain for the entirety of the development process, the steps using PlatformIO will be shared.

1. Install Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the PlatformIO extension.
3. Open the `GoonBoard-HE` workspace.
4. Click on the `PlatformIO: Build` button.
5. Click on the `PlatformIO: Upload` button.
6. Put your microcontroller into DFU mode by shorting `RST` and `GND`.
7. Wait a few seconds and your microcontroller will be recognized as `GoonMandu GoonBoard` with VID:PID `2B00:B1E5`.

## Performance
Tested with ATmega32U4 @ 16 MHz, target polling rate 1000 Hz.

| Metric | RT On | RT Off |

## Pin Assignments
| AVR | Pro Micro | Function | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|
| PD0 | TXO | Row Mux S0 |
| PD1 | RXI | Row Mux S1 |
| PD2 | 2 | Row Mux S2 |
| PD3 | 3 | Row Mux S3 |
| PF4 | A3 | Key Mux S0 |
| PF5 | A2 | Key Mux S1 |
| PF6 | A1 | Key Mux S2 |
| PF7 | A0 | Key Mux S3 |
| PC6 | 5 | RT Enable | Internal Pull-up |
| PB6 | 10 | SPI /SS |
| PB3 | 14 | SPI MISO |
| PB1 | 15 | SPI SCLK |
| *PE6* | *7* | *Debug* | Omitted in release binaries.<br>Only used if `LOGIC_ANALYZER_DEBUG` is defined. |

## Versioning
Format:
```
V{compat}.{YY}{MM}{DD}.{n}
```
- `compat`: Integer. This changing means that the hardware/timing compatibility or pin assignments have changed and is not physically compatible with other `compat` versions.
- `YY`: Two-digit year.
- `MM`: Zero-padded month.
- `DD`: Zero-padded day.
- `n`: Integer. Release number in the same day.

## Maintenance? PRs? Issues?
I will not be paying much attention to this repository once I have implemented the features I want so they will probably be ignored. If you want to build upon this repository and want clarification, *please* feel free to annoy me at:
